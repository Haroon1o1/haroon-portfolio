Nextfolio uses custom MDX for blog posts, making it easy to include JSX components such as interactive embeds, charts, or alerts directly in your markdown content.

Here are some examples of using MDX:

## h2 Heading

### h3 Heading

#### h4 Heading

##### h5 Heading

## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

## Blockquotes

> If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? – Steve Jobs

## Links

- Nextfolio is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
- Nextfolio uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

## CodeBlocks
```js
// This is commented-out code
export default function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  );
}
```

## Images

Nextfolio uses Next.js Image in MDX for seamless image rendering:

<Image
  src="/opengraph-image.png"
  alt="OpenGraph image"
  width={640}
  height={500}
/>

## Embeds

### Tweets

Nextfolio uses react-tweet to embed tweets in MDX posts.

<StaticTweet id="1617979122625712128" />

### YouTube Videos

Nextfolio uses react-youtube to embed YouTube videos in MDX posts.

<YouTube videoId="wXhTHyIgQ_U" />

### Captions

Nextfolio uses react-wrap-balancer to evenly balance captions in MDX posts.

<Caption>
  Captions that flow smoothly, making your content easy to read and visually
  appealing with a clean look.
</Caption>

## Callout

Nextfolio uses a custom callout component to render important information in MDX posts.
